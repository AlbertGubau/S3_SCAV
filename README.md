This is a GitHub repository that has been created to upload the results of SCAV S3.

## Task 1 (Create the videos encoded with VP8, Vp9, h265 and AV1 codecs)
This task has no script associated but we can see the results in the files (we use 480p BBB video of 20 seconds):

## Task 3 (ex2.py)
This script is able to create an interactive Tkinter interface in which users can convert their videos to the desired codecs (VP8, VP9, h265 and AV1).
